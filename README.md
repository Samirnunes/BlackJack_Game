# BlackJack_Game
 Project made in Python 3 for the Udemy's course: Python 3 COMPLETO - Do iniciante ao avançado, during my consulting training at ITA Júnior. The objective was to create a BlackJack game respecting its rules and providing the player some functionalities, such as selecting the bet in the beginning of each play. This project was an interesting way to improve my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) skills in the Python 3 language.
